###Grouply Upload Data By MEAN###
This is a simple Nodejs API, using MongoDB for persistence, Gulp for task automation 
How to use:
Clone the repo and run: 
     `npm install`
Then `cd ../client-side` and `bower install`
After that, change the mongodb Uri in database config object at app/config/db.js
Finally, run:

	node server.js

`http://localhost:8081/`
Task automation:
A JSHint task was provided and it can be started with

	gulp


I am really interested in making this a slush generator soon.
